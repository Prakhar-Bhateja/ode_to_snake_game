# ode_to_snake_game
Snake is a video game genre in which player controls a long, thin creature,
resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane. The concept
originated in the 1976 Gremlin Industries two-player arcade game Blockade,
which, due to its ease of implementation, has hundreds of versions (some titles
include the word snake or worm) on many platforms.
The player controls a point, square, or object on a bounded plane. As it moves
forward, it leaves a path that resembles a moving snake.
## Basic functionalities of snake game:
• Snake can move in a given direction and when it eats the food, the length of snake increases.

• When snake crosses itself, or the wall, the game will over.

• Food will be generated at a given interval.

## Computer Graphics concepts used:
• OpenGL(open graphics library) is a standard specification defining a crosslanguage across platform API for writing applications that produce 2D and 3D computer graphics.

• OpenGL is an application program interface (API) offering various functions to implement primitives, models, and images. It offers functions to create and manipulate render lighting, coloring, viewing the models, translation, rotation, and scaling of objects.

• The method of keyboard interaction was used heavily while making this game.
